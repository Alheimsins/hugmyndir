Share and discover ideas in the physical world.

## What?

It let's you drop an idea, a thought a word of wisdom or whatever at the physical place you are at the moment.
To see your message other people has to visit the same physical spot.

## Why?

I wanted a small, but fun project, to tinker with during my summer holiday.
It has so far been done in [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js), no framework at all and at the moment it's powered by [Choo](https://github.com/choojs/choo).

And there's this: [Why you should make useless things](https://www.ted.com/talks/simone_giertz_why_you_should_make_useless_things)

## How?

I'll explain later. Meanwhile snoop around in the code and guess :-)
